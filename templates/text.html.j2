<p>Since 31 January 2022, national reporting of COVID-19 cases has changed to also include possible reinfections. Our case numbers follow the new definition, which means they include both new infections and reinfections.</p>
 
<p>Note that these numbers are not directly comparable between neighbouring boroughs, or with London as a whole, as population sizes of these places vary widely. See the next section on case rates if you want to compare COVID-19 infection levels between different places.</p>

        {% else -%}<strong>In Lewisham, the case rate for people aged 60 and over was about the same as for the overall population of the borough</strong>, at {{case_rate_60s|thousands_1f}} cases per 100,000 residents.

<h3>What do these numbers mean and why is the case rate important?</h3>

<p>The case rate allows us to compare infection levels between regions and population groups that have very different sizes. A higher case rate means COVID-19 infections are more widespread in a region, relative to the size of the population. The case rate is calculated as the total number of new COVID-19 cases in a region over a period of seven days, divided by the population size of the region, and multiplied by 100,000.</p>
